Action Plan
Test drive a notes app with the following interactions:

#Type of application will be a file you can open and run in the command line or load it to IRB

User can add a note with a title and a body
# user gets prompted - ask user for a title then ask them for content for the note
# create a hash entry for that title and note
# Create a menu system a bit like what we did for the student directory
# hold the notes in an array of hashes

#should i be using classes so maybe a class for the collection of notes or a class for the note itself, so that maybe i can edit the note


User can see a list of all note titles.
# Access the titles from the array of hashes
User can pick a note and see its title and body.
# from a menu user can choose to pick a note by title i guess

The user typing code in IRB as an interface is fine for this.
